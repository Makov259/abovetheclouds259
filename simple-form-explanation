simple-form2 explanation: this is a group project from my university NBU, unfortunatelly for me although it was group project i did 95% of the project due to lack of motivation and work from the other peopple in the team and thus it is not the best. But is client oriented 
project with SpringBoot3 , i use a lot of HTML and CSS even a little JS for a few things.But mainly the language used for the back end is Java! The project is connected to a Postgres Database. This project is designed to help logistics companies to do their work easier.
U have 3 different interfaces ,for the Admin, the Employee and the4 User which have different rights and options.
